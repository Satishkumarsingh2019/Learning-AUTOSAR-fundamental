#Basics Of AUTOSAR â€“ Part 1

AUTOSAR(AUTomotive Open System Architecture) is an open source layered software development standard for, but not limited to, automotive Electronic Control Unit(ECU).

AUTOSAR gives a layered top-down structure for software with relation between the software components.

The layered architecture of AUTOSAR can be divided into Basic Software(BSW), Runtime Environment(RTE) and Application/Software Component layer.

Basic Software layer can be further subdivided into:

1) Micro-controller Abstraction Layer(MCAL) - Provided by microcontroller company (e.g. Infineon, Renesas and so on);
 - MCAL shoud be integrated in Generator tools - Vector Configurator. 
 Vector provide 3rd party integration program that will do the trick.
 
2) ECU Abstraction Later - Provided by Vector Informatik or another vendor company;

3) Services Layer - Provided by Vector Informatik or another vendor company; 

4) Complex Device Driver(CDD) Layer - Create by owner of the ECU project.
   CDD layer shoud be avoid - this mean really old component (develop really long and doesnt have any other place). Modern Autosar developing shoud avoid it.
   
5) .swc - Create by owner of the ECU project.
  Matlab model. Please, avoid any C programing - use StateFlow.

Autosar Basic layer is okey for embedded engineer. App layer is Model Base.

If you enter in this area be sure to stay in a long term in automotive.
